In React Router if a parent component does not have any path but its children have path - it will always render with its children path


axios has almost the same sintax as http and is promise based


-- lifecyle are key point in the component which you can tap into, acces
    -- after render it will mount to the dome

    the process goes like:
    intialized (constructor)
    then render() ->
    then mount ->
    then componentDidMount( a good place to do jqurey, Ajax) because everythhing will be rendered by then an you will able to effectively manipulate stuff
